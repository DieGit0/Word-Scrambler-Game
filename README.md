# Word Scrambler Game
This project was a requirement to obtain the Java Object Orientation Certificate on the Coursera Platform.
It is a Word Shuffler game whose objective is for the player to guess the scrambled words. 
I've implemented three levels of difficulty and there's also the option to ask for help using your points as the game gets even more challenging and fun.
